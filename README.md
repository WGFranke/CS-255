8-2 Journal: Portfolio Submission

The owner Liam, wanted a cloud-based web-system that would help people better learn how to drive by offering course work, scheduled driving lessons with a driver, and tests for a better learning experience. Liam wants the system to host pracitce tests to better prepare them. Allow students to to make two hour driving lessons. Ian, the IT officer, wnats the system to have rtole based access to the system so he can reset passwords and block users. The system also needs to integrate to the DMV to make sure the course work stays up to date. 

I feel like I did a good job of translating Liam's wants for the system and creating the framework for the project. I defined all the users and the specific roles they take in the system, and identified assumptions within the system that could cause a delay in the development of the project. 

If I were to improve one part of these documents to revise I would go into more detail about the DMV integration. One specific feature I would like to add is to fix if the DMV got disconnected from the system. I would add a daily system to check in to the DMV system. If the system did not check in with the DMV then an immediate alert would go out to Ian and Liam.

I used the transcript to interpret Liam's needs for features of the system. I took what Liam wanted in the system and made it into actionable items that could be created in the system. When designing a system considering the user's needs it is vital to the success of the project. Not coordinating and planning with the user's needs will create a complicated, confusing, and unusable system. 

My approach to designing software was to keep the software development life cycle (SDLC) in mind at all times. Understanding the stakeholders and their specific needs would be done before any code was written. Next, I would create a UML diagram to have a visual for the project. Approaching the system as independant modules all interacting together.
